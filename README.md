**Hyde 1.x has been deprecated for the upcoming Hyde 2.0, [available here](https://github.com/poole/hyde).**


## [Hyde](http://andhyde.com)

An elegant open source, mobile first theme for [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). It includes lightweight styles and placeholder content to get you up and running with a simple blog in no time.

## Usage

### 1. Install Jekyll

Hyde is built for use with Jekyll, so naturally you'll need to install that. On Macs, it's rather straightforward:

```bash
$ gem install jekyll
```

**Windows users:** Windows users have a bit more work to do, but luckily [@juthilo](https://github.com/juthilo) has your back with his [Run Jekyll on Windows](https://github.com/juthilo/run-jekyll-on-windows) guide.

You may also need to install Pygments, the Python syntax highlighter for code snippets that plays nicely with Jekyll. Read more about this [in the Jekyll docs](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/#code_snippet_highlighting).

### 2a. Quick start

To help anyone with any level of familiarity with Jekyll quickly get started, Hyde includes everything you need for a basic Jekyll site. To that end, just download Hyde and start up Jekyll.

### 2b. Roll your own Jekyll site

Folks wishing to use Jekyll's templates and styles can do so with a little bit of manual labor. Download Hyde and then copy what you need (likely `_layouts/`, `*.html` files, `atom.xml` for RSS, and `public/` for CSS, JS, etc.).

### 3. Running locally

To see your Jekyll site with Hyde applied, start a Jekyll server. In Terminal, from `/hyde` (or whatever your Jekyll site's root directory is named):

```bash
$ jekyll serve
```

Open <http://localhost:4000> in your browser, and voil√†. You're done.


## Options

Hyde includes a few options, typically applied via classes on the `<body>` element.

### Themes

As of v1.1, Hyde ships with optional themes based on the [base16 color scheme](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16). In Hyde, a theme simply changes the sidebar's background color and the color of links within blog posts. Here's the red theme in action:

There are eight themes available at this time.

To use a theme, add any one of the available theme classes to the `<body>` element like so:

```html
<body class="theme-base-08">
  ...
</body>
```

To create your own theme, look to the Themes section of [Hyde's CSS](https://github.com/mdo/hyde/blob/master/public/css/hyde.css). Copy any existing theme (they're only a few lines of CSS), rename it, and change the provided colors.

### Reverse layout

Hyde's page orientation can be reversed with a single class.

```html
<body class="layout-reverse">
  ...
</body>
```
