(Dear contributors - please insert your recommendations here. Reading, practice, anything you can think of - as long as it helps. Short description is enough. If you see something that needs to be reordered - just do it.)

Week 1
Download and install Intellij Idea
Read through Kotlin Reference: http://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/
Solve Kotlin Koans: https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/koans.html

Hint: There is REPL available in Idea(Tools -> Kotlin -> Kotlin REPL). It provides an opportunity to test and immediately run small batches of code. Very helpful in learning Kotlin syntax.
