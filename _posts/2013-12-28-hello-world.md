Welcome to [Hyde](http://andhyde.com), the perfect companion to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), the popular static site generator. Hyde is an elegant, open source, mobile first theme for Jekyll. It includes lightweight styles and placeholder content to get you up and running with a simple blog in no time.

### Features

* Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, 404, RSS feed, posts, and page)
* [Eight optional color schemes](https://github.com/mdo/hyde#themes), available via `<body>` classes
* Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and [reverse](https://github.com/mdo/hyde#reverse-layout) (right sidebar), available via `<body>` classes
* Mobile first design and development, so it works great on all devices
* Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
* Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
* Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)

### Browser support

Hyde is a rather forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

### Documentation

Docs for setting up and customizing Hyde can be found in the [project readme on GitHub](https://github.com/mdo/hyde#readme).
